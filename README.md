This mod aims to add a small aspect of summer fun to the game by adding **water balloons**!

Craft some water balloons in the crafting table (the recipe is unlocked once you obtain a water bucket).

Then, have some fun by tossing them at each other! They do no damage (unless you are an Enderman), but give you some slowness for a short time!

You can also have fun launching water balloons at each other with a Sling Shot and a Balloon Bazooka! The crafting recipes for those are unlocked by obtaining String and an Iron Ingot respectively)
